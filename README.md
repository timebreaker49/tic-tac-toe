# tic-tac-toe
A little side project to pass the time

#### Background 
As interview practice one day, an engineer asked me to design a tic-tac-toe game. I was only able to implement a board and logic for processing a turn and checking for a winner. I decided to keep working on this as a project to get more familiar with building projects from scratch in Java

#### Implementation
The MVP is a command line game that assumes two players are sitting in front of the same computer~
